# Take-Home Task: Data-Quality Rule Engine

We do **not** expect every requirement finished — we
care far more about design, the quality of what you do complete, and how you
reason about trade-offs. Leave notes on what you'd do with more time.

---

## 1. Context

We validate large volumes of **business-partner master data** (company records:
names, addresses, tax identifiers, bank accounts, …) against a catalog of
**data-quality rules**. A record can be checked by dozens of rules.

Your task is to design and implement a **reusable Java library** that runs this
validation. The library is embedded by several hosts (an HTTP API, batch
workers, scheduled jobs).

We are giving you **requirements, not a design.** How you structure the code,
which types you introduce, and which libraries you use are yours to decide and
defend.

---

## 2. Domain model

- **Record** — one business partner, supplied as a JSON object. A batch is many
  records.
- **Rule** — a named check that computes a **decision** for a record purely from
  the record's own fields. A rule has:
    - a stable **id** and human **label**;
    - logic that computes a **value** from the record's fields;
    - a declarative **decision mapping** from that value → decision, with a
      `default` fallback;
    - metadata: **status** (`DRAFT`/`RELEASED`/`DEPRECATED`), **severity**
      (`ERROR`/`WARNING`/`INFO`), optional **country scope**, and zero or more
      **categories**.
- **Decision** — one of `VALID`, `INVALID`, `REVIEW`, `NOT_APPLICABLE`.
- **Result** — what a rule produced for a record: the decision plus enough
  **provenance** to explain it (at least: which rule, which record, and which
  field(s)/value(s) were evaluated).

---

## 3. Functional requirements

### 3.1 Core — validate a batch

- **F1 Make a Result for each rule.**
    - The engine reads a batch of records and the rule catalog.
    - The engine runs each applicable rule on each record.
    - When a rule produces an outcome, the engine makes one **Result**.
    - A **Result** carries the **decision** (`VALID`/`INVALID`/`REVIEW`/
      `NOT_APPLICABLE`), the rule's **severity** (`ERROR`/`WARNING`/`INFO`), and
      the **provenance**.
    - The provenance explains the decision: which rule, which record, and which
      field(s)/value(s) the rule read.
- **F2 Derive the decision through a declarative mapping, not if/else.**
    - A rule computes a **value** from the record's fields — for example
      `"blocked"` for a blocked country, or `"ok"`/`"bad"` for a format check.
    - A declarative **decision mapping** turns that value into a **decision**
      (e.g. `"blocked" → INVALID`), with a `default` for anything unmapped.
    - A decision is one of `VALID`, `INVALID`, `REVIEW`, `NOT_APPLICABLE`.
    - Keep the mapping as data. Do not hard-code the decision with if-then-else
      inside the rule.
- **F3 Isolate faults.**
    - A rule can fail: bad logic, a bad record, or a missing field.
    - When a rule fails, the engine records a per-rule / per-record **error** with
      enough detail to locate the cause.
    - One failure must not stop the batch or the run.
    - The caller receives both the results and the errors.
- **F4 Give a run summary.**
    - The number of results and the number of errors.
    - A breakdown of results by **decision** (how many `VALID`, `INVALID`,
      `REVIEW`, `NOT_APPLICABLE`).
    - A breakdown of results by **severity** (`ERROR`/`WARNING`/`INFO`).

### 3.2 Extended — scale and selection

- **F5 Process large volumes.**
    - The target is about 1,000,000 records per run.
    - Memory use must stay bounded regardless of total volume.
    - The engine emits each result as it is produced. It must not accumulate all
      results in one list.
    - The batch size is configurable by the caller.
- **F6 Select a subset of the rules.**
    - The caller restricts a run with composable filters that combine.
    - Filter by **status** (`DRAFT` / `RELEASED` / `DEPRECATED`).
    - Filter by **country scope**: a rule applies when its scope is `WORLD` or its
      country equals the record's country.
    - Filter by **category** (a rule has zero or more categories).
    - Whatever the filters select, the engine runs `RELEASED` rules only.

---

## 4. Non-functional requirements

- Plain Java 21 (or later).
- Build with Gradle.
- Keep the source in GitHub with a sensible commit history.
- Choose your own tools and libraries.
- *Other non-functional requirements were deliberately left out — consider what
  else a good library is expected to provide.*

---

## 5. Provided fixtures

Implement so that **this scenario passes** (adapt field/format details to your
model; keep the observable behaviour).

**Records (JSON):**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "r1",
    "vatId": "DE111111111",
    "country": "DE",
    "legalName": "ACME GmbH",
    "iban": "DE123456789"
  },
  {
    "id": "r2",
    "vatId": "FR22",
    "country": "FR",
    "legalName": "Bricolage SARL",
    "iban": "FR123456789"
  },
  {
    "id": "r3",
    "country": "ZZ",
    "legalName": "Nowhere Ltd",
    "iban": ""
  }
]
```

**Rules** (all self-contained, all `RELEASED`):

| id               | logic (computed value)                                           | decision mapping                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `countryBlocked` | `"blocked"` if `country == "ZZ"`, else `"ok"`                    | `blocked→INVALID`, `default→NOT_APPLICABLE` |
| `vatFormat`      | `"ok"` if `vatId` present and length ≥ 9, else `"bad"`           | `ok→VALID`, `bad→INVALID`                   |
| `ibanFormat`     | `"ok"` if `iban` present and starts with `country`, else `"bad"` | `ok→VALID`, `bad→INVALID`                   |

**Expected results:**

| record | `countryBlocked` | `vatFormat`        | `ibanFormat`         |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| r1     | NOT_APPLICABLE   | VALID              | VALID                |
| r2     | NOT_APPLICABLE   | INVALID (len 4)    | VALID                |
| r3     | INVALID          | INVALID (no vatId) | INVALID (empty iban) |

Also demonstrate **fault isolation** — introduce one rule/record that fails and
show the rest of the batch still completes with the failure reported.

## 6. Deliverables

1. **Source** — buildable with Gradle, Java 21.
2. **A short `DESIGN.md`** (this matters as much as the code) covering:
    - your public API and why it's shaped that way;
    - how you achieved fault isolation and bounded memory;
    - the seams you introduced for host-supplied inputs;
    - trade-offs you made under the time-box and **what you'd do next**.
3. **Tests**, and instructions to run them.
4. **Example usage** — a small HTTP API that uses the library to validate a
   batch of records and return the results.

## 7. What we evaluate

- **Library quality** — did they anticipate what makes a library good to embed
  and depend on?
- **Correctness** of the core scenario and the declarative decision mapping.
- **Fault isolation** — results *and* errors, nothing sinks the run.
- **Scale thinking** — streaming vs. accumulation; bounded memory.
- **Extensibility** — clean seams for catalog sources and rule selection.
- **Judgement & communication** — the `DESIGN.md`, the trade-offs, the tests.

We would rather see a **smaller slice done to a high standard** with clear
reasoning than a broad, shaky sketch. If you make an assumption, state it.
